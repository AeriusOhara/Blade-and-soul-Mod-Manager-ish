# Blade-and-soul-Mod-Manager-ish
Hi! Thanks for your interest in my BnS Mod Manager-ish.

Step 1:
First of all, make sure the "Blade and Soul Mod Manager-ish.exe" is in its own folder, because it will create 2 folders for itself!
Now, launch the application and set your Blade and Soul directory by pressing the "Set BnS Folder" button.
Then navigate to the CookedPC folder located in your BnS installation folder.
For me that was in: C:\GAMES\NCSOFT\BnS\contents\Local\NCWEST\English\CookedPC
Press OK when you select the CookedPC folder.
You will see that the "Launch Blade and Soul" button became enabled, yay!

Step 2, optional:
Set the path to your NCSoft Launcher folder by pressing the "Set NCSoft Folder" button.
Then navigate to find "NCSoft Launcher.exe".
For me that was in: C:\Program Files (x86)\NCWest\NCLauncher
When you select the "NCSoft Launcher.exe" press Open and it will save the location.
You might notice once again that now, the "Launch NCSoft Launcher" button became enabled.

Step 3:
Install your mods! Press the "Open Mods Folder" and drag all your .upk files into the folder that opens.
Just .upk files, not zip or rar files, please. After that close the folder and press the Refresh icon.
If everything goes alright, it should say "Found xxx .upk files in the mods folder", you're set!

Step 4:
Press the "Go" button to install the mods. This might take a moment, please sit back or grab a cup of coffee.

Step 5:
After making sure you have the right region selected from the dropdown menu above the "Launch Blade and Soul" button...
Press the Launch Blade and Soul button to play the game!
The only downside to this is that you will need to enter both your e-mail and password ingame, I couldn't find a way to 
have your e-mail be remembered, sorry! :(

#Extra info
Why is there a Launch NCSoft Launcher button? My idea was to use this application like a 
Blade and Soul launch hub. That way I could launch the game directly, or start the launcher 
if there is an update. Speaking of which, when the game whines about there being an update,
make sure to launch this application and press the "Undo" button next to the "Go" button.
If you do not do this and fire up the NCSoft Launcher, it will update and do a file check, 
notice your mods and patch them (adding to your total download size, plus you'll need to
install your mods again!)

#Further disclaimer
I have no idea what mods work for this. The only thing I have been using is the Japanese
voices mods. So if there are any other mods you need to install differently than a simple
fileswap then I can probably not help you, though you can let me know about it and I might
expand the application if it isn't something very time consuming to implement.

Also I am not responsible for your computer blowing up when you use this application, though
it really, really shouldn't happen since all this application does is swap around files and
launch your game.
